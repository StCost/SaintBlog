# ðŸŒŸ Hello World Test Post

This is a test post without a number prefix to demonstrate the improved sorting system.

## About This Post

This post doesn't have a number at the beginning of its filename, so it should appear after all numbered posts in alphabetical order.

## Sorting Logic

The new sorting system works like this:

1. **Numbered posts** (like `001-`, `002-`, `003-`) are sorted by number in descending order
2. **Non-numbered posts** (like this one) are sorted alphabetically
3. **Numbered posts always come first**, then alphabetical posts

## Example

If you have these files:
- `003-latest-post.md` 
- `001-first-post.md`
- `zebra-post.md`
- `002-second-post.md`
- `alpha-post.md`

They will be sorted as:
1. `003-latest-post.md` (highest number first)
2. `002-second-post.md`
3. `001-first-post.md` (lowest number last)
4. `alpha-post.md` (alphabetical starts)
5. `zebra-post.md` (alphabetical ends)

Pretty neat! âœ¨
