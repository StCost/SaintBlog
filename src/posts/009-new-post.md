# 💥 Collapse Machine: Lore, Industries, and World Design

**Collapse Machine** is a co-op sci-fi FPS set on a broken, post-colonial planet. Players travel across strange, terraformed planet — fighting, exploring, stealing, or salvaging—then return to their mobile base to regroup and push forward again. Everything in the world is raw, grounded, and built to feel like you were dropped into a machine that’s still collapsing.

## 🌍 Game Overview

- **Genre:** Open-world, co-op FPS with persistent vehicles and minimal UI
- **Core Loop:** Travel → Find → Fight/Explore → Escape or Extract → Regroup
- **Playstyle:** No hand-holding, no scanners or maps. You follow smoke, lights, ruins, and instincts.
- **Vehicles:** Every player or group has access to **home-vehicles**—custom tanks, zeppelins, or hoverboards with interiors you can walk inside, even while someone drives.

## 🔧 Interface & UI Philosophy

- **No HUD. No mini-maps. No pings.**

- **Inventory = hotbar only**: 12 visible slots. No hidden bags, no weight management.
- **Health/Shield system:** Displayed through thin, segmented bars directly above the hotbar—24 health cells, visible as damage spreads.

## 🚙 Home-Vehicles: Your Safe Zone

> Your escape. Your base. Your home.

- **Modular interiors:** Players can walk inside, decorate, or manage supplies as someone else drives.
- **Types:**
  - **Crawlers/Tanks:** Heavy, armored, can breach hostile sites
  - **Zeppelins/Airships:** Slow-moving, high visibility, floating labs or crew quarters
  - **Hoverboards:** Fast solo escape and recon tools
- **Combat-ready:** Turrets, shields, or stealth features depending on model
- **Diegetic navigation:** Use landmarks, radio towers, trail smoke, or sun position to find your way

## 🎯 Gameplay Themes

- **Travel as gameplay** – Movement is dangerous, but exploration is core.
- **Scavenging vs. Stealing** – Supplies matter. Everything is loot, but not everything is safe to take.
- **You’re not a hero** – You’re a tool, a wanderer, a printed memory with no past.
- **Your enemies are built better—but you adapt faster.**
