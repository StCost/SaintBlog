# 🦓 Zebra Test Post

This post starts with "zebra" so it should appear last in the alphabetical sorting (after numbered posts).

## Purpose

This demonstrates that:
- Posts with numbers come first (sorted by number, descending)
- Posts without numbers come after (sorted alphabetically)
- This post should appear after the "hello-world" post

## Quick Test

You should see the posts in this order:
1. `003-third-post.md` ✨
2. `002-second-post.md` ⭐  
3. `001-first-post.md` 🙏
4. `hello-world.md` 🌟
5. `zebra-test.md` 🦓 (this post)

Perfect sorting! 🎯
